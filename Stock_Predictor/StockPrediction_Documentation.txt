•	This is a machine learning model that is use to predict the future stocks of any company. For instance I have used Apple company stocks for my prediction.
•	This model uses Hidden Markov model to predict the future events.

Libraries that are used for this model
•	Tensorflow_version 2.0
•	tensorflow_probability

Modules and methods that are used
•	HiddenMarkovModel()
•	Distributions
•	mean()

         Pros
•	Easy to implement
•	Can predict any number of future stocks
•	Prediction can be 80 to 87% accurate if the fluctuations are not too high

         Limitations 
•	Can’t predict the accurate stocks if fluctuations are too high.
